################test1.py###############
High res. simulation
ran from balanced initial conditions with perturbation in temp field
Dt = 0.005
Re = Pe = 3*10**5
t_start = 0, t_end = 54
Printed results every 9 time units (5 days) (as pvd files). Also saved the vel and temp fields in .h5 files
Saved kinetic energy at time step (4 min)
Ran the code on 32 cores. It took 35 hours to complete the run.
Observations: The kinetic energy stabilized after dropping in the initial days. (see kinetic energy plot
in ./plots/KE_plot_atm_till_t54.pdf)

############calibration_data_collection.py###############
I am saving .h5 files which corresponds to high res simulation
from t=15 days to t= 25 days. I am saving results at coarse grid time step (corresponding 64x448 mesh) intervals.
Ran on 32 cores.
