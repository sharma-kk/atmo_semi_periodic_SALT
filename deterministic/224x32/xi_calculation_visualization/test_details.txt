##########coarse_graining_residual_disp_calc_t27_to_t30_decor_t_32min.py#########
As the name suggest, we take the high res. data from t27 to t30, coarse grain it
and calculate (u- u_avg)Dt where Dt = 0.04 and c=1/32
We do similar procedure for other time intervals. 

#########calculation_of_xi_combined_x_y_comp_grid_32_c_1_by_32_decor_time_32min_t=27_to_t=45.ipynb#########
xi are calculated from (u-u_avg)Dt data. 
We save the the xi in the folder ./xi_vec_data


##########xi_visualization_grid_32_decor_t_32min_t27_to_t45.py##########
the calculated xi are visualized.
